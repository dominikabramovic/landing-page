# landing-page
Landing page project for The Odin Project course

In this project I'll be making my own landing page from scratch by using flexbox and predetermined styling guidelines.

Most of the content will be placeholder text and images but I may decide to personalize the site mid-project.

The first step will be creating the html content and preventively adding divs to hold elements that will later need to be distributed with flexbox.

Next, I will aplly some basic css according to the provided styling guidelines, but keep the finishing touches for after I rearrange elements, just in case.

Finally, I'll rearrange all the elements using flexbox - header, footer and body (and all its children).
